## Runtime files

```
~/.cco/
├── cco.sock              # Unix domain socket (daemon IPC)
├── state.json            # Agent state snapshot
├── agents/
│   └── <id>/
│       └── output.log    # Claude output log for each agent
└── worktrees/
    └── <repo>-<id>/      # Git worktree per agent (branch: cco/<id>)
```

When `cco agent` is run inside a git repository, a dedicated worktree is automatically created at `~/.cco/worktrees/<repo>-<id>/` on a new branch `cco/<id>` branched from `HEAD`. Claude Code runs inside this isolated worktree so each agent's changes stay separate from the main working tree.
